<h3 align="center"> A Collaborative Journey into Programming Languages and Git </h3>

## 📜Description 
Welcome to **PROJECT_CSLK**, a fun and collaborative project where 30 passionate developers came together to experiment with various programming languages while learning GitHub’s version control systems. Each participant contributed their own creative work—ranging from simple "Hello World" programs to complex games and applications.

Throughout this project, we worked with technologies like  **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Rust** and many more! The main goal was not just to practice coding, but to understand how version control and collaboration work in real-world software development.
